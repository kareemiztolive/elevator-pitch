My name is Mubarak Kareem, I want to become a software engineer because I see the value that it would bring to my professional and personal life. I have always been interested in coding although I  didn't decide to make the plunge and join a coding school until I became introspective and assessed what I wanted to do with my life. That first step I knew I needed to make was to learn the ability to code and write programs that people can use
